Inspired by the original [Windows 3.1 Hot Dog Stand theme](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/).\r\n\r\nHot Dog Stand is only 257 bytes (104 bytes minimized) and only four lines of code, making it the lightest CSS framework around.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThere are no requirements for Hot Dog Stand.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\nAdd `hotdogstand.css` or `hotdogstand.min.css` to your web app's folders, and then the following line to the `<head>` of your HTML:\r\n\r\n````\r\n<link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"hotdogstand.css\" />\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n\r\n* `css`: contains both regular and minified versions of Hot Dog Stand.\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\n\r\n* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/): latest\r\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/): latest\r\n* [Opera](http://www.opera.com/): latest\r\n* [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/): latest\r\n* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/): latest\r\n* [IE](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie): latest\r\n* [Netscape Navigator](): latest\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nHot Dog Stand follows semver, so we won't introduce breaking changes in minor or patch versions. The `master` branch will always have the newest changes, so it's not necessarily production ready. The `stable` branch will always have the most recent stable version of the framework.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFeedback is greatly appreciated!
