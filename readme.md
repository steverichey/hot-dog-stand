# [Hot Dog Stand](https://github.com/steverichey/hot-dog-stand) ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green.svg?style=flat)

This is [Hot Dog Stand](https://github.com/steverichey/hot-dog-stand), a simple, responsive, mobile-first, agonizing, front-end framework for developing the next generation of fully responsive web apps. Inspired by the original [Windows 3.1 Hot Dog Stand theme](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/).

Hot Dog Stand is only 257 bytes (104 bytes minimized) and only four lines of code, making it the lightest CSS framework around.
