<p>A hot dog stand is a food business stand that sells hot dogs, usually from an external counter on a public thoroughfare such as a road, street, ballpark, mall, or food court.</p>
<p>Similar businesses include hot dog wagons or carts, which are portable hand carts with a boiler for cooking the hot dogs and keeping them hot, and hot dog trucks, which are motor vehicles that are set up on a road side location, and often include a complete kitchen for storage and preparation.</p>
<p>These businesses (particularly the mobile, cart kind) are often found in sports stadiums, alongside non-limited access roads, or on the streets of major American cities, such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. According to a report, some hot dog stands are paying up to $80,000 in rents for prime locations in Manhattan, NY.</p>
<p>In Denmark, hot dog stands are called PÃ¸lsevogn (sausage wagons). They serve traditional hot dogs as well as assorted sausages and sausage meats.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the hot dogs from hot dog stands are often called "street meat".</p>
